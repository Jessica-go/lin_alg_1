# Workshop: Linear Algebra for Data Programmers

This is the first workshop in the **Math & Coding** series, designed for programmers and analysts with basic to intermediate Python skills. We explore key mathematical ideas such as vectors, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors — not just in theory, but through a **real-world application**: **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, a widely used method in Data Science and Machine Learning.

### 🔍 Why PCA?

PCA serves as a hands-on example to:
- Understand how linear algebra operates inside real code
- Improve our ability to read and interpret PCA outputs
- Connect abstract math to practical machine learning workflows

The goal is not only to learn linear algebra — but to **understand the mathematics behind the tools** we use in data analysis.

No prior knowledge of advanced math is required. Just curiosity, Python, and a laptop 😉
