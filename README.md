# Workshop: Linear Algebra for Data Programmers

This is the first workshop in the **Math & Coding** series, designed for programmers and analysts with basic to intermediate Python skills. We explore key mathematical ideas such as vectors, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors ‚Äî not just in theory, but through a **real-world application**: **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, a widely used method in Data Science and Machine Learning.

### üîç Why PCA?

PCA serves as a hands-on example to:
- Understand how linear algebra operates inside real code
- Improve our ability to read and interpret PCA outputs
- Connect abstract math to practical machine learning workflows

The goal is not only to learn linear algebra ‚Äî but to **understand the mathematics behind the tools** we use in data analysis.

No prior knowledge of advanced math is required. Just curiosity, Python, and a laptop üòâ

## üîß How to Run This Project

You have two options to run the notebooks from this workshop:

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 1: Run online with Binder (Recommended)

No installation needed ‚Äî just click the button below and start working directly in your browser.

### üñ•Ô∏è Option 2: Run locally on your computer

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jessica-gonzalez/lin_alg_1.git
cd lin_alg_1
```
#### Step 2: Install required packages
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas

If you are using conda: 
```bash 
conda create -n lin_env python=3.10
conda activate lin_env
conda install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
```
#### Step 3: Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash 
jupyter notebook
```

## üì¶ Environment requirements

All required packages are defined in the `environment.yml` file, including:

- numpy  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  
- torch  
- jupyterlab
